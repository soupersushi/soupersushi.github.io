			<p> Born in Saudi Arabia, my family moved around before settling into Washington State. I graduated from Seattle University in 2012 and immediately found work with a small business, <a href ="http://worktankseattle.com/">Worktank Enterprises</a>, as a virtual event producer. Being a virtual event producer also opened up another passion of mine: audio engineering. I am currently producing a podcast, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/killjoy-luck-club" target="_blank"> Killjoy Luck Club</a>, with an inspiring group of women.</p>

			<p>When I am not working, learning about FEWD, or being a part of interesting conversations around feminism; I enjoy being active. Running, walking, biking, playing softball, and (new activity) weightlifting are a few of my favorite things. If I'm not being active and running around, you can most likely find me behind a book, having a beer at a local brewery, spending time with my partner, or taking pictures.</p>

			<p>Currently, I am not looking for work. However, I am looking for learning opportunities. If you have any leads or would like to collaborate on a project please <a href="mailto:cherlaineo@hotmail.com">email me</a>.</p>
